# AudioFlip

AudioFlip is a fork of the original [josetr/AudioDeviceSwitcher](https://github.com/josetr/AudioDeviceSwitcher).

The original `Audio Device Switcher` by `Jose Torres` is a great project and works very well for most users. This fork exists with full respect for that work. I created it to address a few bugs and environment-specific issues I encountered during daily use, while keeping the original workflow and idea intact.

## What this program does

AudioFlip is a Windows utility for quickly switching the system default audio devices for both playback and recording.

- Hotkey-based switching: assign a shortcut and cycle through selected output devices (speakers, headset, interface).
- Microphone routing support: manage recording devices with their own commands and hotkeys.
- Communication device support: switch the Windows Default Communication Device together with your playback/recording profile.
- Background/tray workflow: keep it running in the tray and switch devices instantly without reopening settings.
- Startup support: run automatically with Windows for always-available switching.
- Command integration: generate commands that can be used in external macro/key-mapping tools.

This is especially useful when moving between gaming, calls, streaming, and work setups where audio output/input devices need to change frequently, and it is particularly helpful for dynamically switching microphone and headset setups in Discord.
